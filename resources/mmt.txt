If your money was deducted but your flight was not booked on MakeMyTrip, here are some steps you can take:
first, Check your booking status: Log in to your MakeMyTrip account and check the booking status. Sometimes, due to technical issues or connectivity problems, the booking might not be immediately reflected. Wait for a while and refresh the page to see if the booking appears.
if that does not work, Review your payment confirmation: Verify the payment confirmation you received, such as an email or SMS, regarding the deduction of money. Cross-check the details mentioned, including the amount deducted and the mode of payment.
if payment confirmation is failed, Contact customer support: Reach out to MakeMyTrip's customer support immediately. Provide them with your booking details, payment confirmation, and any other relevant information. You can usually find their contact information on the MakeMyTrip website or app.
you might need documentation for proof. Keep documentation: Maintain a record of all communication with MakeMyTrip, including emails, chat transcripts, or call details. This will be useful for reference and to support your case if necessary.
If nothing works out, Dispute the transaction: If your money is not refunded or the issue is not resolved promptly, consider disputing the transaction with your bank or credit card company. Provide them with the necessary evidence, such as payment confirmation and communication with MakeMyTrip, to initiate the dispute process.
Refund of a hotel booking uses multiple steps. Let's perform the same one by one.
First review the hotel's cancellation policy: Check the terms and conditions of your hotel booking, specifically the cancellation policy. This information can usually be found on your booking confirmation or on the hotel's page on MakeMyTrip. Pay attention to the cancellation deadline and any associated fees.
If you have done that and understood policy, then determine the type of booking: If you booked a non-refundable rate, it means the hotel does not offer refunds for cancellations. In such cases, you are unlikely to receive any refund for the cancelled booking. However, if you booked a refundable rate, you may be eligible for a partial or full refund based on the hotel's cancellation policy.
once the above is done, then cancel your booking: To cancel your hotel booking on MakeMyTrip, log in to your account or access your booking through the MakeMyTrip website or app. Locate your booking and follow the cancellation instructions provided. Make sure to adhere to the cancellation deadline mentioned in the hotel's policy to maximize your chances of receiving a refund.
post cancellation, you will be able to check refund eligibility and fees: After cancelling your booking, MakeMyTrip will determine your refund eligibility based on the hotel's policy and the type of booking you made. If you are eligible for a refund, the amount refunded will depend on the hotel's cancellation fees (if any) and the timing of your cancellation.
you should also know Refund processing time: Once the cancellation is processed, it may take some time for the refund to be credited to your original payment method. The exact processing time can vary and depends on factors such as the hotel's refund processing procedures and your bank's policies.
